        Christian, Cornelius. “Elites, Weather Shocks, And Witchcraft Trials In Scotland.” Accessed 27th January 2023.
         In this paper by Cornelius Christian they write about the effects of weather/temperature on the Scottish economy and how that affects the amount of witchcraft trials. Additionally, they talk about the economic status of the witches and how that could have affected why they were accused.
<br><br>
Christian, Cornelius. The Political and Economic Role of Elites in Persecution: Evidence from Witchcraft Trials in Early Modern Scotland. Review of Economics and Institutions, Università Di Perugia, Vol. 10(2)., 2019. 
	This paper by Christian Cornelius describes how economic prosperity affected the number of witch trials and accusations in Scotland. It also focuses on how price shocks to “export-heavy, taxable goods” affect Witchcraft accusations but price shocks to Scotland's agriculture, specifically oats, did not affect witchcraft trials. Witchcraft trial count was affected by Scotland's “Elites” gaining resources.

Follett, Chelsea. “How Economic Prosperity Spared Witches.” Cato Institute, 28 Oct. 2017,        https://www.cato.org/commentary/how-economic-prosperity-spared-witches.
	This article written by Chelsea Follett describes how a location's economic prosperity can cause an increase in witch related violence even in modern times. Follett lists many different examples of locations with similar poor economic conditions and their incidents with witchcraft accusations. The overall idea is that economic conditions affect violence levels.

In this Journal Article by Julian Goodare they discuss the ways that witch-hunting was used to control and divide women by the state/church. They also mentioned the effect that socioeconomic status, age, and behavior had on the accusations and prosecutions of the Scottish witches.

  Hall, Alaric. “Research Article: Getting Shot of Elves: Healing, Witchcraft and Fairies in the Scottish Witchcraft Trials.” Folklore (London) 116.1 (2005): 19–36. Web.
This article by Alaric Hall focused on the interpretation of language used in the “Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database”. Specifically, how the word “elf/elf-schot/ elf-grippit” continued to be used. Hall explains that it is easy to come to the conclusion that “elf-schot” means to deeply wound someone; but the actual meaning within their culture could have meant a number of different things. Hall makes clear that he believes there is no distinct meaning behind these words, but there is an association with illness/healing.  Also, this article speaks of the relationship of the elf/fairy and the witches with the devil. The devil would offer the witches certain “fortune” in return for a hurt person/ livestock. In conclusion, the language of the text leads it’s audience to make certain assumptions, and further spreading this misinformation.

“James VI of Scotland's 'Daemonologie'.” National Library of Scotland, https://www.nls.uk/learning-zone/literature-and-language/themes-in-focus/witches/source-1/. 
	This article on the National Library of Scotland's website describes the rise in the idea of witchcraft and how King James of Scotland’s experiences with witches caused the need for witch hunting to become prominent. It also describes why James VI wrote the book “Daemonologie” and info about the book. Daemonologie was designed to convince people that were skeptical of witchcraft’s existence that it was real and it should be punished.

  Oster, Emily. “Witchcraft, Weather and Economic Growth in Renaissance Europe.” The Journal of economic perspectives 18.1 (2004): 215–228. Web.2
This article by Emily Oster explains the possible correlation between witchcraft trials and economic growth. It is explained within the text that the witches were blamed for the downfall of the economy, and in turn began to be prosecuted. The theory was that the witches controlled the weather and therefore the crop yield, resulting in a slow, non- growing economy/ population. It is apparent within the article that the witches were not actually controlling the weather, but they were blamed for it. In conclusion, if the growth of the population/ economy was slow, there would be a higher number of witch trials in that area.  
Henderson, Lizanne. “‘Detestable Slaves of the Devil’: Changing Ideas about Witchcraft in Sixteenth-Century Scotland.” Enlighten, 2014. Accessed 27th January 2023.
In this chapter by Lizanna Henderson they talk about the impact that the increasing religious control and the fear mongering about the devil had on witch hunts and trials. They also discussed the effect that occupation and magic type had on accusations and trials, as witches that practiced as folk healers and similar practices were seen as necessary to places without other medical help and thus were sometimes treated more leniently.

Henderson, Lizanne. “The Survival of Witchcraft Prosecutions and Witch Belief in South-West Scotland.” Scottish historical review 85.1 (2006): 52–74. Web.
This historical review done by Lizanne Henderson explains the bias and invalidity in the process of the Scottish Witch trials. Henderson does this by explaining the specifics of particular cases, and the assumptions of the community/ministers. Within the article it is made clear that the typical reasoning behind accusing witches was that they were having trouble with neighbors, arguments about livestock, stress, etc. The central government in Scotland was not nearly as interested in the prosecution of witches as the local ministers were; the ministers had all the power to determine their charge, consequence, etc. Many of the outcomes depended on the opinion of the ministers. 
Martin, Lauren. “Witchcraft and Family: What Can Witchcraft Documents Tell Us About Early Modern Scottish Family Life?” Scottish Tradition -- University of Edinburgh, vol. Vol. 27, 2002. Accessed 31st January 2023.
In this journal article by Lauren Martin they use the socioeconomic data, occupation data, and notes data from the Scottish witchcraft trials to piece together what family life was like back then. They go into detail about the socioeconomic data available about the witches and the commonalities between them, they then go on to show how this information can be used to understand life back then through everything they could piece together from a specific case: Isabel Young. From this article the discussion of socioeconomic status, occupation, and outcomes are especially important towards our topic.
